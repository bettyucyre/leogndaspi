<p>Getting banned from League of Legends can feel like a giant Teemo shroom exploded right on your ranked climb — super annoying and confusing!

<h2 id="maybe-you-are-ip-banned-">Maybe You Are IP Banned? 🌐</h2>
<p>Are your bans following you no matter how many new accounts you make or where you login from? You might be <strong>IP banned</strong>! Riot Games sometimes blocks your internet connection’s IP address, which makes playing from the same network nearly impossible.</p>
