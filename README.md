# How to Get Unbanned on League of Legends (2025 Guide) ⚔️

Getting banned from League of Legends can feel like a giant Teemo shroom exploded right on your ranked climb — super annoying and confusing! If you think your ban was a big oops, this friendly guide will walk you through what to do next and how to appeal for your precious Summoner’s Rift access.

## Maybe You Are IP Banned? 🌐

Are your bans following you no matter how many new accounts you make or where you login from? You might be **IP banned**! Riot Games sometimes blocks your internet connection’s IP address, which makes playing from the same network nearly impossible.

## Step 1: Understand Why You Were Banned ❓

Check your email or the notification in your Riot account to see what triggered the ban. Common causes include:
- Cheating or using third-party software  
- Toxic behavior like flaming, griefing, or verbal abuse  
- Account sharing or suspicious login activity  

**Pro Tip:** Take a quick peek at Riot’s Terms of Use before you send in an appeal — it never hurts to know exactly what you might have broken.

- Any screenshots or notifications you received
